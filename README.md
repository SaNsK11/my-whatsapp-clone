My-Whatsapp-Clone

This is a 1-1 live chatting application that I've built using NextJS.

To run --
//bash 
// yarn dev

This application takes the Email of the recipient and starts the conversation.
I've used Firebase Google authentication for signing in.

The database used is also Firebase.

Running the application --

1) We need to click on 'Start a new Chat' after signing in with Google.
2) Enter the Email id of the person you wish to talk to.
3) Enter the message in the input bar and START TALKING.
//The attachment and emoticon buttons are not yet working, I'll workk on them in the future.
4) For signing out, just click on YOUR Profile picture in the top left corner and you're done.
 
 EASY RIGHT?!
 
 TBH, adding the Last Seen feature and updating the receiver's photo was really challenging but exciting as well.
 
 
 --- The Server side rendering is not as efficient as I'd like it to be..but I'll work on it in the future commits.
